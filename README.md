This repository is designed to provide you with a comprehensive reference for the code demonstrated in our video about how to implement a form with FormX.

## About the Tutorial
In this tutorial, we dive into the process of implementing a form with Flutter, **first using MobX and then refactoring it with [FormX](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_formx)**. Whether you're a beginner looking to expand your Flutter skills or an experienced developer, this tutorial has something for you.
The video complements the content in this repository by providing detailed explanations with a step-by-step walkthrough.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into different commits to showcase the incremental progress of the form's development.
Each commit corresponds to a specific stage of the tutorial and highlights the changes made to the codebase.
